        <h1>History of the Buffalo National River</h1>
        <h2>153 Miles of History</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>The Buffalo National River, a 153-mile-long river in the Ozark Plateau, became the first national river in the United States on March 1, 1972. 
            It flows freely for 135 miles and is one of the last undammed rivers in the lower 48 states. 
            It was established by President Nixon and placed under the protection of the National Park Service 100 years after Yellowstone National Park's establishment. 
            The river has been an attraction for its inhabitants since prehistoric times and has two state parks along its course.</p>

        <p>In the 1960s, opposing organizations formed to oppose a dam on the Buffalo River. 
            Governor Orval Faubus withdrew his support in 1965, leading to the introduction of the first Buffalo National River Park legislation in 1967. 
            The park, which covers 94,293 acres, allows hunting and fishing as traditional uses and offers permanent residents the option of use and occupancy for up to 25 years.</p>

        <p>The Buffalo River has experienced several algal blooms since establishing a C&H/Cargill hog farm in 2013, but in 2018, the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality denied C&H's permit to operate the farm, making it one of America's Most Endangered Rivers. 
            The park is a popular tourist destination in Arkansas, with over 800,000 visitors annually. 
            It includes 135 miles of river, 100 miles of hiking trails, and three congressionally designated wilderness areas.</p>
        
        <p>The park also features four historic districts on the National Register and individual sites depicting the cultural history of the river's peoples. 
            The Arkansas Farm Bureau officially adopted a policy opposing any potential redesignation.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The Buffalo National River is home to a fossil record that spans over 180 million years, including those of crinoids, ancient sea creatures related to starfish and sea urchins, and bears, peccaries, giant armadillos, and hundreds of pounds of additional bone material.</li>
            <li>The Buffalo River is home to 200 species of birds and 55 species of mammals, including the Bald Eagle, Northern Bobwhite, Cerulean Warbler, Swainson's Warbler, and Louisiana Waterthrush.</li>
            <li>The Buffalo National River got its name from the common occurrence of the American bison in the vicinity of the Buffalo. The word buffalo is derived from the French "buf," a name given to bison when French fur trappers working in the US in the early 1600s saw the animals.</li>
