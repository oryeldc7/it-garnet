        <h2>What to know</h2>
        <p>
          Formerly Toltec Mounds Archeological State Park, Plum Bayou is one of four National Historic Landmarks in the Arkansas State Park system. 
          This park interprets the largest and most complex mound site in the state. It also offers the rare opportunity to see archeological research at work. 
          This site was a ceremonial ground for prehistoric Native Americans and stands today as an important and fascinating piece of history. 
          A popular field trip destination for local schools, the park recommends that requests for guided tours be made well in advance. 
          Located 4 miles from Scott, a short and beautiful drive from Little Rock.

              The Plum Bayou Mounds in Arkansas were built by the Plum Bayou culture around 1,000 years ago and provide fascinating insights into ancient Native American civilizations. 
              They consist of earthen mounds and ceremonial structures, offering a glimpse into their social and ceremonial practices.

            <p>
              Out of Arkansasâ€™s 52 state parks, Plum Bayou Mounds Archeological State Park is only of three Native American parks. The other two are Parkin Archeological State Park and Hampson Archeological Museum State Park. It is also only one of two state parks that partner with the Arkansas Archeological Survey in which the labs are managed with full-time archeologists. Parkin is the other. Unlike Indiana Jones, the state archeologists unearth artifacts both young and old that tell us about the people who lived here. Their job tasks include anything from site surveys, artifact identification, mapping, botanical research and much more. One of the most important archeological evidences they find is not in the soil but the soil itself. The type of soil, its density, and color sometimes tell more of a tale than artifacts. One example of importance is that archeologists are able to see where structures once stood because of the way wooden posts decompose and leave different color circles of soil. <a href="#">Read More &raquo;</a>

              Most people think archeologists only find information from arrowheads, pottery, and other stone tools at Native American sites. However, there are unexpected artifacts that are found here that tell us even more about who lived here. Quartz crystal is no stranger to Arkansas in that we find a lot of it here but we find it in the western side of the state. Here at the mound site, we find quartz pieces, as well as crystal arrowheads that are on display in the museum. It must have been an important piece for them to take the time to travel the distance to get this quartz, and then shape points out of this really hard mineral. Other interesting archeological finds are bits of copper from the Great Lakes Region and conch shell from the Gulf of Mexico. This tells us that the Plum Bayou people must have been trading or traveling great distances. Visitors can also view each of these artifacts in the park museum. <a href="#">Read More &raquo;</a>
