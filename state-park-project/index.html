        <h2>What to know</h2>
        <p>
          Formerly Toltec Mounds Archeological State Park, Plum Bayou is one of four National Historic Landmarks in the Arkansas State Park system. 
          This park interprets the largest and most complex mound site in the state. It also offers the rare opportunity to see archeological research at work. 
          This site was a ceremonial ground for prehistoric Native Americans and stands today as an important and fascinating piece of history. 
          A popular field trip destination for local schools, the park recommends that requests for guided tours be made well in advance. 
          Located 4 miles from Scott, a short and beautiful drive from Little Rock.

            <p>
              Arkansas's Plum Bayou Mounds Archeological State Park is one of three Native American parks out of 52 state parks, along with Parkin Archeological State Park and Hampson Archeological Museum State Park. It is one of two state parks that partner with the Arkansas Archeological Survey, managed by full-time archeologists. State archeologists unearth artifacts, site surveys, and botanical research, focusing on soil type, density, and color. They can also identify structures by decomposing wooden posts and leaving different color circles of soil.            </p>

            <p>
              Archaeologists often find information from Native American sites, but unexpected artifacts in Arkansas reveal more about the people who lived there. Quartz crystal, found in the western side of the state, is on display at the mound site. Crystal arrowheads and quartz pieces are on display in the museum. Other interesting finds include copper bits from the Great Lakes Region and conch shells from the Gulf of Mexico, indicating the Plum Bayou people likely traveled great distances. Visitors can view these artifacts in the park museum.            </p>
