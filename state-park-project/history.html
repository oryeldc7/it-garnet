        <h1>HISTORY</h1>
        <p>
            The Plum Bay Mounds site (formerly Toltec Mounds), located on the bank of an oxbow lake, was occupied by Native Americans between 650 and 1050 AD. 
            The site was the primary religious center for the people who lived in the countryside, who grew domesticated plants, hunted animals, and fished and gathered nuts and wild plants. 
            The Plum Bayou Culture, a distinct group of Native Americans, used the site for ceremonies and ceremonies. 
            The mounds were built gradually over 300 years, with 18 mounds arranged around two rectangular open spaces. 
            The original heights of the mounds are unknown, but all are less than four feet high. 
            Some mounds were used as platforms for ceremonies or had religious leaders' residences. 
            The site was abandoned around 1050 and later used by later Native Americans of the Mississippian Period for ceremonies and burials. 
            The site was reported to Joseph Henry, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, by Mary Eliza Knapp of Little Rock in 1876. 
            Archaeologists from Harvard University and the Bureau of Ethnology explored the site in 1879 and 1882, but interest in the site waned when no pottery vessels or other distinctive artifacts were discovered. 
            The mounds were gradually reduced in height by plowing after farming began in the 1850s, and some mounds were deliberately leveled in the 1960s.</p>

          The Toltec Mounds, originally called the Knapp Mound Group, were once thought to be built by the Toltecs and Aztecs in Mexico. 
          However, research by the Smithsonian Institution in 1883 provided evidence that mounds were built by local Indian ancestors. 
          In 1888, landowners Gilbert Knapp, Mary Eliza Knapp, and Eustis Officer named the railway station Toltec, which remains used by the locals. 
          The Division of Arkansas State Parks established Toltec Mounds Archeological State Park, later renamed Plum Bayou Mounds Archeological State Park. 
          Archaeologists conducted a brief excavation in 1966, estimating the time the mounds were used. 
          The site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, and the Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism purchased the land in 1975. 
          The Arkansas Archeological Survey began a long-range research program in 1976, collecting information about the Plum Bayou Culture and the way of life over 1,000 years ago.
