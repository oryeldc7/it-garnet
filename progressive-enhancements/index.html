    Progressive enhancement in web development is a process similar to an archaeological dig, starting with the basic content layer, accessible to everyone regardless of their device or browser. 
    As the web becomes more diverse, advanced features and styles are added to enhance the experience for users with more capable browsers or devices. 
    This ensures that everyone can access the basic content, while those with the means can enjoy the added features. 
    Progressive enhancement is about inclusion and building for the future, ensuring the web works for everyone today and remains ready for future users and technologies. 
    It is a way to preserve context and ensure the web remains functional for all users.
